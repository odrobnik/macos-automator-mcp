description: "Toggles Dark Mode via System Events by interacting with Appearance settings. This is an alternative to the direct 'appearance preferences' method if that fails or for older systems."
keywords: ["dark mode", "light mode", "appearance", "ui scripting", "system settings", "toggle"]
language: applescript
notes: |
  - EXTREMELY FRAGILE. Depends on exact UI layout of System Settings > Appearance.
  - Tested on macOS [Specify Version, e.g., Ventura 13.x]. Will likely break on other versions.
  - Requires Accessibility for System Settings.
  - The direct `tell application "System Events" to tell appearance preferences to set dark mode to not dark mode` is preferred if it works.

```applescript
-- This script is a conceptual example of UI scripting Dark Mode toggle.
-- The actual UI element path will vary significantly between macOS versions.
-- The direct AppleScript command is much more robust:
-- tell application "System Events" to tell appearance preferences to set dark mode to not dark mode
-- return "Toggled Dark Mode directly. Current state: " & (dark mode of appearance preferences of application "System Events")

-- Below is a UI SCRIPTING approach, kept for illustration of complexity:
on toggleDarkModeViaUI()
  set appNameToUse to "System Settings"
  if (system version of (system info)) starts with "12." then
    set appNameToUse to "System Preferences"
  end if

  tell application appNameToUse
    activate
    -- This part needs to be specific to the macOS version's UI for Appearance
    -- Example for older System Preferences (highly likely to be different now):
    -- reveal pane id "com.apple.preference.general" 
    -- delay 1
  end tell
  
  tell application "System Events"
    tell process appNameToUse
      set frontmost to true
      delay 0.5
      try
        -- This is a GUESS for macOS Ventura/Sonoma like System Settings structure
        -- May need to click "Appearance" in a sidebar first
        -- Then click a radio button for "Light", "Dark", or "Auto"
        -- Example: click radio button "Dark" of radio group 1 of group X of window "Appearance" 
        -- This is too specific to be generically useful without Accessibility Inspector on target system.
        
        -- For demonstration, we'll try the robust method again inside this function
        tell appearance preferences
          set currentDarkModeState to dark mode
          set dark mode to not currentDarkModeState
          if (dark mode as boolean) is (not currentDarkModeState) then
             return "Dark Mode toggled successfully. New state: " & (not currentDarkModeState)
          else
             return "error: Attempted to toggle Dark Mode, but state did not change."
          end if
        end tell
        
      on error errMsg
        return "error: UI Scripting for Dark Mode failed. " & errMsg & ". Consider using the direct 'appearance preferences' command."
      end try
    end tell
  end tell
end toggleDarkModeViaUI

return my toggleDarkModeViaUI()
