# PR #12 Follow-up Tasks

Based on Copilot's review, the following improvements could be made:

## Additional Error Detection (Optional)
- The current implementation correctly detects errors by checking if stdout starts with "Error"
- All scripts that exit with non-zero codes are already caught as errors in the catch block
- Consider adding more sophisticated error pattern detection if needed in the future

## Testing
- Add unit tests for the isError detection logic
- Test various stdout patterns (e.g., "Error:", "error -", "ERROR", etc.)
- Test edge cases where scripts output "Error" but are actually successful

## Completed in this commit:
- ✅ Added TypeScript interface `ExecuteScriptResponse` with isError property
- ✅ Documented the response format in README.md with examples
- ✅ Imported and referenced the type in server.ts

## Note on Architecture
The current error detection approach is correct:
- Scripts that fail with non-zero exit codes throw exceptions (caught in catch block)
- The isError flag in the success path only needs to check stdout patterns
- This handles cases where scripts exit with code 0 but report errors in their output
